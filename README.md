# Scrolllock-Lights
 A way to turn LEDs on in Linux

 This is a project to help keyboard backlights work on Linux.
 
 At base, this project will look for LEDs called "input(num)::scrolllock". If you would like it to work for other files in the /sys/class/leds path, feel free to open an issue or email me.

# Installation

Run install.sh using a command line interpreter. This must be done as root.
